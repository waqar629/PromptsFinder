# 🌟 My Portfolio Website  

Hi! I'm **Waqar Hassan**, a Frontend Developer, and this is my **personal portfolio website**. I built this to showcase my skills, projects, and experience in web development. I wanted to create a space where potential employers and collaborators can explore my work easily.  

## 🚀 What I Built  
- **React.js & SCSS** for a modern and responsive design.  
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and better user experience.  
- **React Hooks & Functional Components** for clean, reusable code.  
- **Admin Dashboard** to update content dynamically without modifying code.  
- **Deployed on Netlify** for fast and easy access.
